Find-And-Replace-Single
=======================

Find And Replace is designed as an agent used in searching for and replacing specified terms within a disk-based file hierarchy. Find And Replace replaces terms within plain text files, filenames and foldernames. The file types scanned for the search term are specified in a config.ini file. Multiple Search and Replace terms can be defined using ;; as the delimiter string.  Created by Craig Lotter, January 2007
